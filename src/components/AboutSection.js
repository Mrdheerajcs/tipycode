              Coinmen was founded in 2010 by three visionary men who currently
              serve as our Founding Partners. They come from different portfolios of
              tax and financial advisory but the three of them shared a common goal
              while starting this company, and was to establish a firm which puts the
              client's interest first and helps the client's business grow.
